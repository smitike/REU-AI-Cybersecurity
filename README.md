# Main Purpose
Develop algorithms that utilize the temporal and spatial relationships captured by the GNN to trace the origin of an attack within the network graph. Question: Can dynamic GNNs accurately trace back and identify the source of cybersecurity attacks within a network?

# Expected Outcomes
Accurate Source Tracing: tracing the origin of attacks, preventing the spread, and predicting the impact of the spread on the whole network.
# Approach
Attack Source Identification
 Approach: Utilize the temporal and spatial dependencies captured by the dynamic GNN to trace back the source of an attack.
 Techniques: Graph traversal algorithms, backtracking methods in the GNN framework.

# Quantum Integration
How QNNs Help: QNNs can improve the traceability of attack sources by analyzing the temporal and spatial relationships in network data more effectively. Quantum algorithms can analyze these relationships in a highly parallel manner, leading to faster and more accurate identification of attack sources. Example Approach: Developing quantum-enhanced graph traversal algorithms that leverage the principles of quantum entanglement to trace the origin of attacks​ (SpringerLink)​.

https://github.com/VainF/Torch-Pruning: works with different neural network architectures, including GNNs. Could easily adapt to our needs without requiring architecture-specific modifications. Structural pruning is useful for real-time requirements.
Integration: Check how well the pruning technique can be integrated with your existing GNN model for source tracing. The integration should not disrupt your model's primary function.
